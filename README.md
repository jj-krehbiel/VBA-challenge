# VBA-challenge
The attached text file contains my VBA code to be used for excel sheets that contains the following yearly stock information information:
  
    Column 1: Ticker symbol
    
    Column 2: Date of trade sorted from the earliest date to the latest
  
    Column 3: The opening trade price for the given date
  
    Column 4: The highest trade price for the given date
  
    Column 5: The lowest trade price for the given date
  
    Column 6: The closing trade price for the given date
  
    Column 7: The trade volume for the given date
  
  
The code will output the following information for each individual stock in the corresponding columns:
  
    Column 9: Ticker symbol
  
    Column 10: The yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  
    Column 11: The  percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  
    Column 12: The total stock volume of the stock
  
  
The code also uses conditional formating to highlight positive percent change in green and negative percent change in red.


I've also included screenshots to demonstrate how the output will look when run with data for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016.
